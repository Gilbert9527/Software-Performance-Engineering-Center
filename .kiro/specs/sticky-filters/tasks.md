# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Enhance CSS sticky positioning and styling
  - Update existing `.dashboard-filters` CSS to use `position: sticky`
  - Add enhanced `.dashboard-filters.sticky` styles with backdrop blur and shadow
  - Create smooth transition animations for sticky state changes
  - Implement responsive sticky behavior for different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Create StickyFilters JavaScript class
  - Implement core StickyFilters class with constructor and initialization
  - Add scroll detection using Intersection Observer API for performance
  - Create methods for transitioning between sticky and normal states
  - Implement theme-aware styling updates that sync with existing theme system
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Implement layout shift prevention
  - Create placeholder element system to maintain layout when filters become sticky
  - Add dynamic height calculation to prevent content jumping
  - Implement smooth transitions that preserve scroll position during filter interactions
  - Handle edge cases for responsive breakpoint changes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Add responsive sticky behavior
  - Implement mobile-specific sticky positioning with appropriate offsets
  - Create touch-optimized sticky filter controls for mobile devices
  - Add adaptive layout that works properly across different viewport sizes
  - Ensure sticky functionality doesn't interfere with mobile navigation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Integrate with existing theme system
  - Connect sticky filter styling with current light/dark mode theme switching
  - Ensure backdrop blur and shadow effects work properly in both themes
  - Update theme toggle functionality to refresh sticky filter appearance
  - Test theme transitions while filters are in sticky state
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 6. Initialize sticky filters in main application
  - Add StickyFilters initialization to existing main.js or dashboard.js
  - Configure sticky options for optimal user experience
  - Integrate with existing filter functionality (applyFilters, resetFilters)
  - Ensure sticky filters work properly with dashboard tab switching
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 7. Add error handling and browser compatibility
  - Implement fallback behavior for browsers without sticky position support
  - Add feature detection for Intersection Observer API with polyfill
  - Create graceful degradation for older browsers
  - Add error handling for edge cases and dynamic content changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Write comprehensive tests for sticky filter functionality
  - Create unit tests for StickyFilters class methods and state management
  - Write integration tests for scroll behavior and theme switching
  - Add responsive behavior tests for different screen sizes
  - Test filter functionality while in sticky mode to ensure no regressions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
