# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements sticky filter conditions that remain fixed at the top of the page when users scroll down. This improves user experience by keeping filtering controls accessible at all times, allowing users to modify filters without having to scroll back to the top of the page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the filter conditions to remain visible and accessible when I scroll down the page, so that I can easily modify filters without losing my current position in the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls down the page THEN the filter section SHALL remain fixed at the top of the viewport
2. WHEN the filter section becomes sticky THEN it SHALL maintain its original styling and functionality
3. WHEN the user interacts with sticky filters THEN all filter controls SHALL remain fully functional
4. WHEN the page is scrolled back to the original filter position THEN the filter section SHALL return to its normal document flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sticky filter section to have appropriate visual styling, so that I can clearly distinguish it from the rest of the content when it's in sticky mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the filter section becomes sticky THEN it SHALL have a subtle shadow or border to distinguish it from content below
2. WHEN the filter section is sticky THEN it SHALL maintain proper z-index to appear above other content
3. WHEN the filter section becomes sticky THEN it SHALL have appropriate background color that matches the current theme (light/dark mode)
4. WHEN transitioning between sticky and normal states THEN the visual changes SHALL be smooth and not jarring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sticky filter functionality to work properly on different screen sizes, so that I can use filters effectively on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN the sticky filters SHALL remain functional and properly sized
2. WHEN the viewport width changes THEN the sticky filter section SHALL adapt its layout appropriately
3. WHEN on smaller screens THEN the sticky filter section SHALL not take up excessive vertical space
4. WHEN the filter section is sticky on mobile THEN touch interactions SHALL work normally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the page layout to adjust properly when filters become sticky, so that there are no visual jumps or layout shifts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the filter section becomes sticky THEN the page content below SHALL not jump or shift unexpectedly
2. WHEN the filter section transitions to sticky mode THEN appropriate spacing SHALL be maintained to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN the filter section returns to normal flow THEN the page layout SHALL smoothly return to its original state
4. WHEN filters are sticky THEN the page scroll position SHALL be preserved during filter interactions
