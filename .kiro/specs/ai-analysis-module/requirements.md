# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing AI analysis module to support multiple file format uploads (PDF, Markdown, Excel, Word, TXT) with a 5MB size limit. The system will integrate with SiliconFlow's API to analyze uploaded files and generate comprehensive analysis reports. Users will be able to configure custom prompts through settings, with fallback to default AI analysis capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload various file formats (PDF, Markdown, Excel, Word, TXT) for AI analysis, so that I can analyze different types of documents without format restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a file for upload THEN the system SHALL validate that the file format is one of: PDF, Markdown (.md), Excel (.xlsx, .xls), Word (.docx, .doc), or TXT
2. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file size does not exceed 5MB
3. IF the file format is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating supported formats
4. IF the file size exceeds 5MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the size limit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to extract and process content from uploaded files, so that the AI can analyze the actual document content regardless of format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content from the PDF
2. WHEN a Markdown file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL read the raw text content
3. WHEN an Excel file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract data from all sheets and convert to readable format
4. WHEN a Word document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content from the document
5. WHEN a TXT file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL read the plain text content
6. IF content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to integrate with SiliconFlow API for AI analysis, so that I can leverage advanced AI capabilities for document analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes extracted content THEN it SHALL send the content to SiliconFlow API using the provided API key
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use the endpoint https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions
3. WHEN API integration fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN API response is received THEN the system SHALL process and format the analysis results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure custom analysis prompts in settings, so that I can tailor the AI analysis to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide a prompt configuration option
2. WHEN a custom prompt is configured THEN the system SHALL use it for AI analysis requests
3. IF no custom prompt is configured THEN the system SHALL use default AI analysis capabilities
4. WHEN prompt settings are saved THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration for future use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive comprehensive analysis reports, so that I can understand the AI's insights about my uploaded documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a formatted analysis report
2. WHEN displaying the report THEN the system SHALL include the original filename and analysis timestamp
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL provide options to save or export the results
4. WHEN multiple files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of analysis reports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API key to be securely stored in configuration, so that the system can authenticate with SiliconFlow API without exposing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load the API key from a secure configuration file
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include the API key in request headers
3. IF the API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL validate the API key format
